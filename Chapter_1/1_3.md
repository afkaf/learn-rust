### Chapter 1: Introduction to Rust

#### 1.3 Installing Rust and Setting up the Environment

Installing Rust is straightforward, and the primary tool used for managing Rust installations is `rustup`. `rustup` is a command-line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools. Here's how to get started:

**Step 1: Install rustup**

- **On Windows:** Download and run the rustup-init.exe from the official [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). This will install `rustup`, the Rust compiler (`rustc`), and the Rust package manager (`cargo`).

- **On macOS and Linux:** Open a terminal and run the following command:
  ```sh
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```
  This script downloads and runs `rustup-init`, which installs the necessary tools.

After installation, you’ll need to restart your terminal or run the following command to configure your current shell:
```sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

**Step 2: Verify the Installation**

Once installed, you can verify the installation and check the installed version by running:
```sh
rustc --version
```

**Step 3: Update Rust**

To update Rust to the latest version, use the following command:
```sh
rustup update
```

**Step 4: Configure the IDE**

While you can write Rust code in any text editor, it’s recommended to use an IDE with Rust support for a better experience. Popular IDEs include:

- **Visual Studio Code** with the Rust extension (rust-analyzer).
- **IntelliJ IDEA** with the Rust plugin.
- **Sublime Text**, **Atom**, or **Eclipse** with respective Rust plugins.

You can also use the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021) to follow along in most of these lessons, but it is recommended to install it locally and get familiar with the development environment.

I'll be using Sublime Text with the Rust Enhanced package installed and my terminal to build and run any example code. This tutorial will be written assuming you are using something similar, but you can use any IDE or text editor and still follow along with the lessons.

After installing your chosen IDE, ensure that it is configured to recognize your Rust installation. This usually involves setting the path to the Rust toolchain that `rustup` installed. We'll ensure everything is set up correctly with a simple "Hello, World!" program in the next section.
